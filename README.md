<h2>Crayon Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA</h2>

<p><strong>Crayon</strong> allows  developers visually organize and track their work by assigning
background colors to files in the project view.</p>

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Assign Colors to Files:</strong> Mark files with specific colors (called "crayons") to indicate their status or categorize them by functionality.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove Assigned Colors:</strong> Easily remove colors when they are no longer needed.</li>
  <li><strong>View and Manage Colored Files:</strong> Access a comprehensive list of all files with assigned colors through the settings menu.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use Cases:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Code Review and Refactoring:</strong> Mark files based on their review/refactoring status (e.g., "reviewed," "in progress," or "pending").</li>
  <li><strong>Feature Tracking:</strong> Assign colors to files implementing specific features, even if they are scattered across different directories.</li>
  <li><strong>Legacy Code Understanding:</strong> Highlight files that require special attention while exploring unfamiliar codebases.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Crayon</em> is designed to enhance productivity by enabling developers to visually organize and prioritize their tasks within the project view.</p>
