Crayon is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that helps developers visually organize and track their work by assigning
background colors to files in the project view.

## Features

- **Assign Colors to Files**: Mark files with specific colors to indicate their status or categorize them by
  functionality.
- **Remove Assigned Colors**: Easily remove colors when they are no longer needed.
- **View and Manage Colored Files**: Access a list of all files with assigned colors through the settings menu.

## Use Cases

- **Code Review and Refactoring**: Track the status of files during the review or refactoring process.
- **Feature Tracking**: Assign colors to files implementing specific features, even if they are located in different
  directories.
- **Legacy Code Exploration**: Highlight files that require extra attention when navigating through older codebases.
